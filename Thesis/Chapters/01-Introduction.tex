\chapter{Introduction}

The introduction is usually a short chapter that can be read in less than 10 minutes.

The goal of the Introduction is to engage the reader (why you should keep reading).
You don't have to discuss anything in detail. Rather, the goal is to tell the reader:
\begin{itemize}
%  \item Why something has to be done (why the thesis topic is important),
  \item what is the problem dealt with and why the problem is a problem;
  \item what is the particular topic you're going to talk about in the thesis;
  \item what are your goals in doing so, and what methodology do you follow;
  \item what are the implications of your work.
\end{itemize}

The above points will be further expanded in the following chapters, so only a glimpse is essential. 

\medskip

It is customary to conclude the Introduction with a summary of the content of the rest of the thesis. One or two sentences are enough for each chapter.
