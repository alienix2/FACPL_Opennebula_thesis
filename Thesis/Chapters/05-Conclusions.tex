\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}

They say that the conclusions are the shortened version of the introduction, and while the Introduction uses future verbs (we will), the conclusions use the past verbs (we did). It is basically true.

In the conclusions, you might also mention the shortcomings of the present work and outline what are the likely, necessary, extension of it.
E.g., we did analyse the performance of this network assuming that all the users are pedestrians, but it would be interesting to include in the study also the ones using bicycles or skateboards.

Finally, you are strongly encouraged to carefully spell check your text, also using automatic tools (like, e.g., Grammarly\footnote{\url{https://www.grammarly.com/}} for English language).
